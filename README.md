# About
This project is a custom [Friday Night Funkin’](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin) engine based on [Psych Engine 1.0.4](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine), developed with a primary focus on Pico Playable, inspired by the official Friday Night Funkin’ Pico content.

The engine preserves the core structure of Psych Engine while introducing custom systems and internal tweaks to support Pico as a fully playable character. This includes animation handling, gameplay logic adjustments, and compatibility with existing songs, charts, and events.

The main goal of this project is to provide modders with an engine that simplifies the creation of Pico-centered mods, without sacrificing the flexibility, stability, and features of the original Psych Engine
